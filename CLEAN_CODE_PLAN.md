---

## 🎯 Clean Code Objectives

1. **Reduce complexity** - Keep cyclomatic complexity < 10 per method
2. **Improve readability** - Clear naming, proper documentation
3. **Eliminate code smells** - Duplicated code, long methods, large classes
4. **Enhance maintainability** - Consistent patterns, proper error handling
5. **Increase testability** - Better separation, dependency injection

---

## 📋 Phase 1: Code Analysis & Detection (Week 1)

### 1.1 Automated Analysis
- [ ] Run static analysis tools (SonarLint, SpotBugs)
- [ ] Identify code smells with PMD
- [ ] Check complexity with JaCoCo
- [ ] Review test coverage gaps

### 1.2 Manual Code Review ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Review all `@Service` classes for complexity
  - BotService: 300 lines, 18 public methods - Well organized, command handlers extracted
  - WorkflowService: 262 lines, 20 public methods - Clean, uses use case pattern
  - MetricsService: 116 lines - Simple, focused responsibility
  - TokenEncryptionService: 142 lines - Single responsibility, well tested
- [x] Review all domain entities for anemic patterns
  - Workflow: 285 lines with rich behavior (activate(), deactivate(), validate())
  - WorkflowExecution: 268 lines with business logic and domain events
  - BotConfiguration: 111 lines with validation methods
  - Message, User, SystemLog: Appropriate for their domain responsibilities
  - **Result**: NO anemic domain model - entities have proper business logic
- [x] Review all controllers for proper error handling
  - WorkflowRestController: 181 lines with proper DTO usage
  - GlobalExceptionHandler: Comprehensive with 5 exception handlers covering all scenarios
  - **Result**: Excellent error handling with domain exceptions and proper HTTP status codes
- [x] Review all adapters for consistency
  - TelegramBotAdapter: 116 lines, implements BotPort correctly
  - WhatsAppBotAdapter: 38 lines, placeholder with consistent interface
  - **Result**: Consistent implementation following Ports & Adapters pattern

### 1.3 Documentation Audit ✅ COMPLETED
**Target**: Comprehensive documentation review

- [x] Check JavaDoc coverage for public APIs (MetricsService comprehensive, others already documented)
- [x] Verify all use cases have clear descriptions (package-info.java created)
- [x] Ensure domain events are documented (package-info.java with examples)
- [x] Review inline comments for clarity (all complex logic properly commented)

---

## 🔧 Phase 2: Critical Improvements (Week 2)

### Priority: HIGH

#### 2.1 Method Complexity Reduction ✅ COMPLETED
**Target**: All methods with cyclomatic complexity > 10

- [x] Extract command handlers from `BotService.processCommand()` (34 lines, 4 branches)
  - [x] Created `BotCommandHandler` interface
  - [x] Implemented `StartCommandHandler`
  - [x] Implemented `HelpCommandHandler`
  - [x] Implemented `StatusCommandHandler`
  - [x] Implemented `WorkflowsCommandHandler`
  - [x] Implemented `UnknownCommandHandler`
  - [x] Fixed circular dependency with `@Lazy`
- [x] Review and simplify use case execute methods if needed (all are simple and focused)
- [x] Check WorkflowService for any complex methods (all methods are under 30 lines)

**Common patterns to fix:**
```java
// Before: Long method with multiple responsibilities
public void processMessage(String message) {
    // 50+ lines of logic
}

// After: Extract methods
public void processMessage(String message) {
    validateMessage(message);
    Message parsed = parseMessage(message);
    processCommand(parsed);
    sendResponse(parsed);
}
```

#### 2.2 Error Handling Consistency ✅ COMPLETED
**Target**: Standardize exception handling across the application

- [x] Create `BotNotFoundException` exception
- [x] Create `WorkflowNotFoundException` exception
- [x] Create `WorkflowExecutionNotFoundException` exception  
- [x] Replace generic RuntimeException in `BotService.getBot()` (line 54)
- [x] Replace generic RuntimeException in `WorkflowService.getWorkflow()` (line 81)
- [x] Replace generic RuntimeException in `WorkflowService.getExecution()` (line 183)
- [x] Replace generic RuntimeException in `WorkflowService.getExecutionByProcessInstanceId()` (line 191)
- [x] Update `GlobalExceptionHandler` with new exception handlers
- [x] Add error codes to API responses

**Pattern to apply:**
```java
// Use custom domain exceptions
public class WorkflowNotFoundException extends RuntimeException {
    public WorkflowNotFoundException(Long id) {
        super(String.format("Workflow with id %d not found", id));
    }
}

// Consistent error responses
@ExceptionHandler(WorkflowNotFoundException.class)
public ResponseEntity<ErrorResponse> handleNotFound(WorkflowNotFoundException ex) {
    return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND)
        .body(new ErrorResponse(ex.getMessage()));
}
```

#### 2.3 Naming Improvements ✅ COMPLETED
**Target**: Clear, intention-revealing names

- [x] Review all method names in services for clarity (all names are clear and descriptive)
- [x] Check variable names in complex methods (all variables well-named)
- [x] Ensure class names reflect their responsibility (all classes properly named)

**Examples:**
```java
// Before: Unclear
public void process(Long id) { ... }

// After: Clear intent
public void activateWorkflowById(Long workflowId) { ... }

// Before: Abbreviations
public void execWf(Long id) { ... }

// After: Full words
public void executeWorkflow(Long workflowId) { ... }
```

## 🎨 Phase 3: Code Smells Elimination (Week 3)

### Priority: MEDIUM

#### 3.1 Duplicated Code ✅ COMPLETED
**Target**: DRY principle violations

- [x] Check for duplicated validation logic across services (no duplication found)
- [x] Review error handling patterns for duplication (consistent use of custom exceptions)
- [x] Check DTO/entity mapping for repeated code (all use builder pattern consistently)
- [x] Look for similar query building patterns (no duplication found)
- [x] Extracted `saveMessage()` helper method in BotService to eliminate duplication between inbound/outbound message saving

**Detection:**
```bash
# Find duplicated code blocks
grep -r "similar pattern" src/main/java/
```

**Solution patterns:**
```java
// Extract to utility class
public class ValidationUtils {
    public static void validateNotNull(Object obj, String fieldName) {
        if (obj == null) {
            throw new ValidationException(fieldName + " cannot be null");
        }
    }
}

// Extract to mapper
public class WorkflowMapper {
    public static WorkflowResponse toResponse(Workflow workflow) {
        // Centralized mapping logic
    }
}
```

#### 3.2 Long Parameter Lists ✅ COMPLETED
**Target**: Methods with > 3 parameters

- [x] Review `BotService.processInboundMessage()` (5 parameters) - Created `InboundMessageRequest` parameter object
- [x] Review `BotService.saveInboundMessage()` (5 parameters) - Now uses internal helper method
- [x] Check use case constructors for long parameter lists (all use dependency injection, acceptable)
- [x] Consider parameter objects where appropriate - Implemented `InboundMessageRequest` DTO

**Pattern to apply:**
```java
// Before: Long parameter list
public void createWorkflow(String name, String description, 
                          String bpmnXml, Long userId, 
                          Map<String, Object> metadata) { ... }

// After: Parameter object
public void createWorkflow(CreateWorkflowRequest request) { ... }

public record CreateWorkflowRequest(
    String name,
    String description,
    String bpmnXml,
    Long userId,
    Map<String, Object> metadata
) {}
```

#### 3.3 Large Classes ✅ COMPLETED
**Target**: Classes with > 300 lines or > 10 public methods

- [x] Review `BotService.java` (299 lines → reduced with helper method and parameter object)
- [x] Review `WorkflowService.java` (263 lines - acceptable, well-organized)
- [x] Review `Workflow.java` (285 lines - acceptable, rich domain model with clear sections)
- [x] Check UI view classes for size (all under 300 lines)

**Solution:**
```java
// Before: One large service
public class WorkflowService {
    // 20+ methods
}

// After: Split by responsibility
public class WorkflowQueryService { ... }
public class WorkflowCommandService { ... }
public class WorkflowValidationService { ... }
```
